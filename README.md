# Hash-Based Load Balancer in SDN

## General Info
This project aims to build a simple load balancer in a Software Defined Networking (SDN) environment using the IP hash algorithm.  
Network traffic from clients is forwarded to different servers based on a hash of their IP addresses.  
The network is built using Mininet, and traffic is managed by the Floodlight controller.
